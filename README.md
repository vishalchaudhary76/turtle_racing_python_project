# 🐢 Python Turtle Race

A fun and interactive **Turtle Racing game** built using Python's `turtle` library! Multiple turtles race across the screen, and the first one to reach the finish line wins.

## 🛠 Features

## ⚡ How It Works

1. The user inputs the number of turtles (racers) they want.  
2. Turtles are randomly assigned colors.  
3. Each turtle moves forward a random distance in each step.  
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line is declared the winner.
